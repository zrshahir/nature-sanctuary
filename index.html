<h1>What's Healing Nature?</h1>
<p>Being active in nature truly can help by allowing us to fight chronic diseases, relieve stress and depression, promote way much faster healing, stronger immune systems, and so much more. Judging by brand-new research, contact with nature truly is most likely to affect us both mentally and physically right down to those cells of ours. We can't live without nature. Judging by so many studies, it has been shown that adults who exercised in nature did have way much lower levels of tension, confusion, anger, and depression then when they did exercise indoors. A recent Australian and United Kingdom study similarly did find out that people who went to parks for 30 minutes or more every week were far way much less likely to have high blood pressure or poor mental health than people who didn't.</p>
